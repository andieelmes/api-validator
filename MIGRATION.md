# Migration

## 4.0.1 â†’ 5.0.0

Due to Crafter update Node.js 12 support has been dropped.

Crafter migration guide [says](https://github.com/funbox/crafter/blob/master/MIGRATION.md#501--600) that it should probably work with Node.js 12 though.

Anyway, you'd better not to use Node.js with a version less than 14.
